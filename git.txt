What is version control system ?
	 is a class of sytems used for managing different types of files in our project code
What is the use ?
google : searching 24x7 working
	- global server:can accessible to everyone

college website:server is not getting,busy server
	- which provides the services to the end user(people)

two servers:local server and global server
	- Git (local server)
		- in our local machine
	- Github (remote/global server)
		- In cloud



======================
Commands:
	git init
		- used initialize the local server
	git add file name
		- move the files from unstaging area(local machine) to staging area(local server)
	git status 
		- you can check the status of git
	git add . : helps us to add all the files at once
	- YOUR CONFIGURATION
	git config --global user.email "your email id"
	git config -- global user.name "name"
	git config user.email :to check your email id
	git config user.name:to check your name
--- commitment:
	 2 friends:ram & syam : help(utilize):money purchase(commitment)
	- git commit -m "commit message"
	- git status
	- git log
		 -contains the information of author, time and no.of commits along with their SHA key
	- Secure Hash Algorithm which represents the address of our commit
-- program: completed(in max 10 mins)
-- project:mini projects(max 1 sem)
-- final project:2 sems (4th year) 1 year:
	- day by day work to be store
===============================
to remove the file from server
	- git restore --staged file_name
	- git rm --cached file_name
	- git log --oneline
		- short description of our log
		- contains 7 char lenth SHA key and commit msg only
=======================================
one after the other:A B C
	 A part , B  and C
	- A :mis match of data elements:final output

	- interlinked project:communication may mismatch
	- loss of data and time consuming
===========================
Server is decentralized or distributed
	- A&B&C together worked
	- work efficiency and accuracy is more
